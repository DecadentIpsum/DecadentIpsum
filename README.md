# Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">, I am Andreas Zaralis!

![twitter-follower](https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/DecadentIpsum?style=social)

My name is Andreas Zaralis and I have experience in ReactJS, GatsbyJS, NextJS, and Graphql as well as Typescript. 

Over the last 3 years, I help agencies and companies with modern web development (JAMstack) tools. This includes web development using Static Site Generators, Headless CMS, CI / CD, and CDN setup.

My web development toolset contains technologies like Next.js, Gatsby, Prismic, Sanity, and DatoCMS to name a few, which deliver incredible performance, high security, amazing scalability and low expenses on maintenance.
