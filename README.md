### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Andreas Zaralis and I have experience in ReactJS, GatsbyJS, NextJS, and Graphql as well as Typescript. 

Over the last 3 years, I help agencies and companies with modern web development (JAMstack) tools. This includes web development using Static Site Generators, Headless CMS, CI / CD, and CDN setup. 

My web development toolset contains technologies like Gatsby, Next.js, Contentful, and DatoCMS to name a few, which deliver incredible performance, high security, amazing scalability and low expenses on maintenance.
